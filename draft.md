The methodology is available both on the app ("About the Model" tab) as well as on my blog <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/06/16/draft-probabilities-2.html">here</a>. A suggested application of the methodology, which proposes a new approach to draft pick value, is available <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/06/20/draft-probabilities-3.html">here</a>.

I reached out to Ian Levy at Nylon Calculus to see if he was interested in having the same methodology applied to the NBA draft. He <a href="https://fansided.com/2020/09/17/nba-draft-class-controversial-obi-toppin/">was</a>.
