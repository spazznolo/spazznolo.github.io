<h5>Background</h5>
Around 2016, a few years removed from a Mathematics degree, my interest in proofs, statistics, and even logic puzzles was waning. I was leaning away from this towards creative pursuits. I was working odd jobs, reading fiction and making music. It was during this time, in this state of mind, that my brother lent me the book <em><a href = "http://www.hockeyabstract.com/statshot">Stat Shot</a></em>. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Stat Shot</em> was written as an entry point for the casual fan to understand advanced hockey statistics - as a fun, entertaining way to explore a different perspective of the sport. It was meant to be a light read, but this was not how I read it. To me, it was a blueprint. I came to understand the research process as a creative one. 
</p>
<p>
In my experience, research usually unfolds as follows: a curiosity arises from watching sports, listening to narratives, reading research papers, or just in conversations with friends; this then gives way to a qualitative debate both for and against the original idea; then, various quantitative frameworks are drafted, usually mentally. Based on the idea's complexity cost and worth, it is either pursued or forgotten. 
</p>
<p>
This process led me from independent research in hockey, to an internship at the St Lawrence River Institute, to my career as a Data Scientist in applied research at Statistics Canada, and to this blog.
