<h2>Extending the Application of Prospect Pick Probabilities</h2>
<p>
In <a href="">An Application of Prospect Pick Probabilities</a>, I outlined a potential real-world use case for the <a href="">draft probability tool</a> that Prashanth Iyer and I created, which included a new perspective on draft pick value. Here, I extend the methodology to include prospect value uncertainty, and an optimization of pick value.
