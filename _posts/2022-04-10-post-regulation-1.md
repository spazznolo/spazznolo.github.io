A team's performance in regulation has little relation to its performance in overtime. On average, teams with a 10% increase in xGF% in regulation experience about a 1.9% increase in xGF% in overtime. This is about the same xGF% increase as a team gets in overtimes played at home (1.7%).

This isn't so surprising, though. Broken up into 5 minute chunks, hockey is actually pretty random! Breaking regulation time into 5 minute chunks, a 10% positive deviance in a team's xGF% in a given chunk leads to about a 0.2% increase in its xGF% performance in the next chunk. For context, the home team sits at a 1.5xGF% increase just for being at home.
