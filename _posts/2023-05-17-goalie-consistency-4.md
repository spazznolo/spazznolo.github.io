<h2>[Post 4] Bayesian Save Percentage</h2>
<p>
Recall from from the introductory paragraph of this series:
"Goaltenders make up the least predictable position in hockey. Their behavior confounds analysts and casual fans alike. It isnâ€™t uncommon for a good goalie to have a below replacement level year, or for an unknown goalie to come in and dominate the league for a stretch of time. This may partly explain the relative dearth of analysis on goalies - they're voodoo, it's often said."

<p>
Let's again look at uncertainty, but this time, instead of the uncertainty in goalie performance we'll look at the uncertainty in goalie skill. There's a difference. In the previous three posts I looked at the variance in game-to-game outcomes, but this time I want to look at the variance in a goalie's actual expected save percentage. To do this, we'll use empirical Bayes. This has been explored in previous papers [link]. This will be a launchpad for more detailed, rigorous research.

Let's start with an example. Using only Fenwick Save Percentage, who's the better goalie, Andrei Vasilevski or Jeremy Swayman? Well, looking at their career Fenwick Save Percentage, Swayman is ahead - he's at .942 while Vasilevski's at .941. However, Swayman has faced only 2,159 shots, while Vasilevsky faced 19,155. How can we take into account the fact that Vasilevsky has been elite with a greater body of work?

To start simply, here's a histogram of career goalie save percentages, unadjusted.

Given a new goalie we know nothing about, it is reasonable to represent their possible career save percentage as the plot above. Now, the histogram above is a rough distribution - there are bumps throughout which seem random. In order to smooth this, we need to fit a distribution on it.

<p>
The beta distribution is a common prior when the variable of interest is a percentage (as is ours with the save percentage). Here's what fitting a beta distribution to the career save percentage distribution looks like. This will be our <em>prior</em>.

The beta distribution has some interesting, clean properties. First of all, it
