<h2>LIVEBLOG 017: Player Detect Demo</h2>
<p>
It's been a while. I've been working on a court/player detection demo. I'm going to run a demo on an entire match and troubleshoot from there. So far one point has been processed and the results were encouraging. I'm trying to find a way to embed videos here, but the file size is just too big for github pages so far. Maybe I'll upload some demos to Youtube later.
