<h2>Deriving pick probabilities from NHL draft rankings</h2>
The probabilities are generated through a process which primarily involves the application of a rank-ordered logit model to professional draft rankings released throughout the year. The methodology is a simplified version of <a href="https://ecp.ep.liu.se/index.php/linhac/article/view/480">Predicting the NHL Draft with Rank-Ordered Logit Models</a>, developed by xxx.
</p>
<p>
There are three main components to the model - imputation of partial rankings, fitting of a Plackett-Luce model, simulation of drafts based on Plackett-Luce coeffxxx.
