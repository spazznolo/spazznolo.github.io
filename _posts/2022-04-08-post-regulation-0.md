<h2>How important is post-regulation time?</h2>
<p>
Since 2015, when a game is tied after 60 minutes of play, both teams are awarded a point along with the opportunity for another point in the form of the overtime. Most of the rules from regulation carry over, except for a few important ones - the play goes from 5 players aside to 3, and the period lasts only 5 minutes. These rules are geared towards increasing entertainment in the form of chaos - the ice surface is too large and the players are too fast and too skilled to prevent chances.

<p>
This series of posts will attempt to address the effects of this change in playing format, by answering questions like: Is this chaos created by the rule change an equalizer of sorts? ...
</p>
<p>
But first, in this post, we'll look at how many overtime games a team can expect to play in a given year.
(If a team is about league average, it follows that they're the closest in skill to all other teams, which itself could lead to more overtime appearances.)

Technically, you could make the case to drop the few historically <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/2017.html">bad</a> <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DET/2020.html">teams</a> as outliers, in which case there would be a slight but statistically significant decrease in overtime games as a team performed better, which would amount to a roughly 4% (or, 3.28 game) increase in overtime games a season between the worst and best teams, but this is moving away from the spirit of the analysis and will be ignored.
