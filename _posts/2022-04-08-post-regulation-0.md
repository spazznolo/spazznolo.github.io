<h2>How important is post-regulation time?</h2>
<p>
Since 2015, when a game is tied after 60 minutes of play, both teams are awarded one standing point along with the opportunity for a second point in the form of the overtime. Most of the rules from regulation carry over, except for a few important ones - the play goes from 5 players aside to 3, and the period lasts only 5 minutes (compared to 20 in regulation). The format change is geared towards increasing entertainment in the form of chaos - the ice surface is too large and the players are too fast and too skilled to prevent chances.

<p>
This series of posts will attempt to address the effects of this change in playing format, by answering questions like: Is a given game's regulation play an indicator for its overtime play? Does a team's play in overtime <em>before a goal is scored</em> indicate who is more likely win? Is the chaos created by the playing format change an equalizer of sorts? 
</p>
<p>
But to start things off, we'll finish this post by looking at how many overtime games a team can expect to play in a given year.

Pre-Overtime Standing Points Per Game vs % of Games going to Overtime
</h5>
There isn't much of a relationship between a team's regular season performance and the number of times they make it to overtime. Let's assume going forward in this series that the number of OT appearances of a given team is random and centered around 27%.

Technically, you could make the case to drop the few historically <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/2017.html">bad</a> <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DET/2020.html">teams</a> as outliers, in which case there would be a slight but statistically significant decrease in overtime games as a team's standing performance increased, which would amount to a roughly 4% (or, 3.28 game) increase in overtime games a season between the worst and best teams, but this is moving away from the spirit of the analysis and will be ignored.
