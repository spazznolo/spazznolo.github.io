<h2> The effects of inter-shot goalie consistency (using real data) </h2>
<p>
</p>
<p> 
It turns out - as the plots below will show - that there isn't much there. A goalie's inter-shot consistency in a given season doesn't say much their inter-shot consistency in the next season, better goalie careers don't appear to have more or less consistency than a worse career, etc. 
</p>
<p>
Note: A goalie season must include at least 800 shots (roughly 20 games) to be included in the season comparisons, and goalie-career must include at least 5 seasons, facing at least 800 shots in each, to be included in the career comparisons.
