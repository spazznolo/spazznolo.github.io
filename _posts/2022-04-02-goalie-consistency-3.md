<h2>[Post 3] Goalie Consistency: The inter-shot effect on expected standing points</h2>
<p>
To measure the effect of inter-shot consistency on expected standing points, we simulate 10,000 goalie seasons, all with seasonal save percentages of .900, by sampling seasonal shot outcomes without replacement into a sequence (or, a season). Then, we calculate the <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/03/28/goalie-consistency-intro.html">entropy</a> of each simulation, along with the expected standing points earned. The results are below.

<em>Inter-shot consistency does not seem have an effect on expected standing points.</em>

<p>
The <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/07/goalie-consistency-3.html">next post</a> will use entropy as a measure for goalie consistency on real data. It will be a similar exploration to <a href="https://github.com/namitanandakumar/Draft-Analysis/blob/master/Streakiness/VanHAC%202018.pdf">this one</a> on shooters, except it will be expanded to include weights on shots in the form of <a href="https://moneypuck.com/">MoneyPuck</a>â€™s Expected Goals.
