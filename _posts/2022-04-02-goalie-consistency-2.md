<h2> Does consistency matter in Goaltending? </h2>
<h2> Part 2 - Exploring the effects of goalie consistency using real data </h2>
<p>
In the <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/03/29/goalie-consistency-1.html">previous post</a>, the concept of entropy as a measure of consistency was <a href="https://github.com/namitanandakumar/Draft-Analysis/blob/master/Streakiness/VanHAC%202018.pdf">repurposed</a> for hockey goalies using simulated data. Here, it's applied to actual NHL data, supplied by <a href="https://moneypuck.com/">MoneyPuck</a>.
</p>
<p>
Remember: to measure entropy, an entire goalie season is first turned into a binary sequence of 0's (saves) and 1's (goals). SHOW ENTROPY IS HIGHER FOR WORSE GOALIES. WE NORMALIZE. Now that entropy has been normalized, consistency can be compared from goalie-to-goalie.

<h5>The effect of goalie consistency on season save percentage</h5>
<p>
In this comparison, a goalie season must include at least 800 shots and every shot is considered equal.
