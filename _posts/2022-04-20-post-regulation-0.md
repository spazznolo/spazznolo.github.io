<h2>[Introduction] How important is post-regulation time?</h2>
<p>
Since 2015, when a game is tied after 60 minutes of play, both teams are awarded one standing point along with the opportunity for a second point in the overtime. Most of the rules from regulation carry over, except for a few important ones - the play goes from 5 players aside to 3, and the period lasts only 5 minutes (compared to 20 in regulation). The format change is geared towards increasing entertainment in the form of chaos - the ice surface is too large and the players are too fast and too skilled to prevent chances.
</p>
<p>
This series of posts will attempt to address the effects of this change in playing format, by answering questions like: Does a team's regular season success translate to overtime success? Is a given game's regulation play an indicator for its overtime play? Does a team's play in overtime <em>before a goal is scored</em> indicate who is more likely win? Can we predict who will get the next shot? Is the chaos created by the playing format change an equalizer of sorts? 
</p>
<p>
To finish the introduction, let's look at how many overtime games a team can expect to play in a given year using data from 2015-2019 (this overtime format was introduced in 2015 and 2020 was an incomplete year).

<h5>
Pre-Overtime Standing Points Per Game vs % of Games going to Overtime
</h5>
There isn't much of a relationship between a team's regular season performance and the number of times they make it to overtime. You might have thought - like me - that average teams tend to have more overtime appearances because they're more closely skilled with the rest of the league than exceedingly strong/weak teams, but no, there isn't much there*. Let's assume going forward in this series that the number of OT appearances of a given team is random and centered around 23%.
