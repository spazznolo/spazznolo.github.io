<h2>[Post 6] Goalie Performance Assessment: The Problem with Time</h2>
<p>
In post 4, I outlined a framework for measuring goalie talent using their career Fenwick 5v5 save percentage. It concluded with the assumptions of the initial strategy, which I'll include again below.
</p>
<p>
Assumptions:
    - The prior distribution is assumed to be from the beta family.
    - Age is assumed to be irrelevant. 
    - Scoring rates are assumed to be constant.
    - All shots are assumed to be equal. 
    - Team systems are assumed to be identical.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to address the second point in this post.
