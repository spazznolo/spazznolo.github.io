<h2>LIVEBLOG [Post 6] GitHub Repository</h2>
<p>
I created a <a href="https://github.com/spazznolo/tennis-tracker">repository</a> for this project in the off-chance it snowballs into something bigger. Tracked a game today, or 10 60 seconds chunk of a game between Federer and Djokovic on clay. The camerawork was a little more dynamic than the first two games I tracked, but the court detection approach using a set of heuristics with hough lines did not faulter, which is encouraging. Also, downloaded all the necessary games for the initial model and started using Todoist, an app to track my project tasks.
