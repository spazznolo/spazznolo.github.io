<h2>LIVEBLOG 008: Tracking Games [Part 2]</h2>
<p>
I tracked all the clay games today. That's 40 minutes of broadcast time. It took an hour in total. Tracking at 1.5x realtime is twice as fast as I did in my test runs with the Williams final, which is encouraging.

The set of heuristics for the court detection strategy is coming together. It's starting to look like a sophisticated model won't be necessary. I have to test it, of course, but I've been greedy and taken random frames from games to see how the initial attempt holds up and it's doing well.
