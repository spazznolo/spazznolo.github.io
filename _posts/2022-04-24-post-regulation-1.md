<h2>[Post 1] Measuring the uncertainty caused by the current overtime format</h2>
<p>
By most accounts, the outcome of the NHL's 5 minute 3-on-3 overtime is random. <a href="https://moneypuck.com/">MoneyPuck</a>, a popular website which predicts game outcomes in real time, assigns a coin flip probability for any team to win in overtime, regardless of their opponent. This is in line with sports betting sites, which, in a given overtime, usually offer -115 odds for both teams (even odds before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish">vig</a>).

For now, let's take this at face value (we'll save the skepticism for another post). The consequence of this is that, after regulation time, the team's essentially flip a coin to determine the winner. If a given team happens to get lucky and land a bunch of heads, it gets more points than another team who happened to land a bunch of tails. This randomness causes uncertainty in the final standing points, which could have an effect on the final rankings and, importantly, if a team makes the playoffs or not - or a team's chance at winning the draft lottery.
