<h2>LIVEBLOG 016: Pipeline Build 01/h2>
<p>
Started thinking about tying together the modules to get the desired output for a single point. This will force me to zoom out and notice the fault lines of the project so far. One thing I'm curious to see is how robust the imputation will be. For example, if a player is misidentified (and this should be obvious), we can impute their location by taking their last known location. One frame is not enough time to really change one's court location very much.
