<h2> Does consistency matter in Goaltending? </h2>
<h2> Part 3 - Exploring the effects of goalie consistency using advanced data </h2>

In the <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/03/29/goalie-consistency-1.html">previous post</a>, the concept of entropy as a measure of consistency was <a href="https://github.com/namitanandakumar/Draft-Analysis/blob/master/Streakiness/VanHAC%202018.pdf">repurposed</a> for hockey goalies using simulated data. Here, it's applied to actual NHL data, supplied by <a href="https://moneypuck.com/">MoneyPuck</a>.
