It is difficult to understand a goalie's path by looking at their save percentage or shots faced in isolation. What's nice about the empirical Bayesian method introduced in the previous posts is that it considers these measures at the same time. Moreover, we can repeatedly re-evaluate a goalie's pAdjSV% after each shot they face. We can then plot this posterior over each shot of a goalie's career to get a sense of their path. In order to extract more insight from this, let's section goalies by their career shots faced, like this:
</p>
<p>
Goalies facing:
    - less than 300 shots -> -0300.
    - more than 300 shots, but less than 1,500 -> -1500.
    - more than 1,500 shots, but less than 6,000 -> -6000.
    - more than 6000 -> 6000+.
</p>
<p>
As an example, Braden Holtby's pAdjSV% after facing various shot totals:
    - 0 shots: 0.9417 (as is every goalie's)
    - 1,000 shots: 0.9421
    - 5,000 shots: 0.9425
    - 10,000 shots: 0.9452
    - 15,000 shots: 0.9450
    - 19,555 shots: 0.9433

<p>
Some thoughts:
    - Nearly every goalie (77.1%) who faces -6000 shots ends his career with a pAdjSV% below expected.
    - Goalies facing 1500+ but -6000 seem to fade as their career progresses.
    - These goalies tend to be backups, facing ~600-1000 shots a season.
    - This fade could partly be due to aging effects.
</p>
<p>
To get a clearer sense of the dynamics described above, let's take the group average pAdjSV% through each shot faced.

</p>
<p>
Some thoughts:
    - The effects are much clearer here.
    - There isn't much to glean from goalies facing -300 shots.
    - These short NHL careers are almost certainly due to reasons outside their play in the NHL.
    - Goalies facing -1500 shots fade quickly. They are given a decent look and fail acutely.
    - Goalies facing -6000 shots start as the best group through the first 1,000 shots, then fade.
    - This seemingly unintuitive result is likely due to randomness, and, more interestingly, age.
</p>
<p>
Let's revisit the unintuive plot comparing pAdjSV% over goalie careers, grouped by career length. This time, we'll plot the average age of goalies in each group as they face shots over their career.

</p>
<p>
Some thoughts:
    - Goalies facing -6000 shots are ~1.5 years older than 6000+ goalies throughout their career.
    - This difference obviously includes the span from age 23 to roughly 27.
    - This is precisely the age range in which goalies seem to be improving in AdjSV%.
    - We can adjust for this.
