<h2>LIVEBLOG [Post 1] Hello, tennis</h2>
<p>
The other day I was at a bar and the US Open was on. I don't particularly watch much pro tennis, so I was surprised by the clean camerawork. Very elegant - during actual gameplay, the camera is static on a lengthwise shot which captures the entire court. It only moves slightly when a shot is hit wide and then goes right back to that symmetric static shot. I figured tennis analytics must be booming ahead of other sports because of this, so I searched for what people have come up with and found... <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/uy0zl4i1/release/4">this</a>. Basically, the author, a <a href="http://on-the-t.com/">tennis researcher</a>, lists all the reasons why teenis is decidedly NOT booming, and actually lagging all other major sports.
