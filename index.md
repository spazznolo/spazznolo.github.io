Around 2016, my brother lent me the book <em>Stat Shot</em>. It was marketed as an entry point for the casual fan to understand advanced hockey statistics; a fun, entertaining way to xxx. This was not how I read the book. I had a degree in Mathematics and a proclivity for logic puzzles, but at the time I was leaning away from all of this towards creative pursuits. It wasn't until I read this book that I realized the vision that was necessary to come up with research ideas. This process, where spontaneous curiosities give way to qualitative xxx which then, usually, give way to quantiative xxx, has occurred naturally since then. It lead my early independent work in hockey, to an internship at the St Lawrence River Institute under xxx, to my career as a Data Scientist in applied research at Statistics Canada, and to this blog. This blog serves as an outlet to explore ideas which naturally occur from watching sports, listening to narratives, reading other research papers, or just in conversations with friends.
