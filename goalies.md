<h5>Goalie Performance</h5>
In the first post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/05/17/goalie-performance-1.html">Empirical Bayes Save Percentage</a>, I introduce a framework to evaluate goalie performance using empirical Bayes. In the second post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/05/22/goalie-performance-2.html">Empirical Bayes Adjusted Save Percentage</a>, I refine the methdology by accounting for shot quality. In the third post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/05/24/goalie-performance-3.html">Exploring the Distribution</a>, I refine the prior distribution by accounting for performance bias (goalies who perform well tend to face more shots). In the fourth post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/06/04/goalie-performance-4.html">Age is Confounding</a>, I explore the effects of age on performance, and then attempt to account for it.

<h5>Goalie Consistency</h5>
In the first post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/03/28/goalie-consistency-1.html">Does consistency matter in goaltending?</a>, the topic is introduced. In the second post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/03/30/goalie-consistency-2.html">The effect of inter-game consistency on expected standing points</a>, the topic is introduced. In the third post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/02/goalie-consistency-3.html">The effect of inter-shot consistency on expected standing points</a>, the topic is introduced. In the fourth post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/07/goalie-consistency-4.html">The effects of inter-shot goalie consistency (using real data)</a>, the topic is introduced.
