Around 2016, I was a few years removed from a Mathematics degree and a proclivity for logic puzzles, leaning away from all of this towards creative pursuits. I was working odd jobs and reading the books a typical Math major doesn't come across - xxx. This was the state of my mind when my brother lent me the book <em>Stat Shot</em>. It was marketed as an entry point for the casual fan to understand advanced hockey statistics; a fun, entertaining way to xxx. This was not how I read the book.  

It wasn't until I read this book that I realized the vision that was necessary to come up with research ideas. This process, where spontaneous curiosities give way to qualitative xxx which then, usually, give way to quantiative xxx, has occurred naturally since then. It lead my early independent work in hockey, to an internship at the St Lawrence River Institute under xxx, to my career as a Data Scientist in applied research at Statistics Canada, and to this blog. This blog serves as an outlet to explore ideas which naturally occur from watching sports, listening to narratives, reading other research papers, or just in conversations with friends. Posts are grouped by topic in the header, but can be accessed in chronological order below.

I'm currently helping Prashanth Iyer build an <a href="https://piyer97.shinyapps.io/NHLDraft2023/">interactive NHL draft tool</a> by implementing a rank-ordered logit model to draft rankings from publications over time.

I'm also building a <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/01/15/tennis-framework.html">tennis tracking program</a>, which hopefully will scale to the level where entities (players and ball) can be tracked for entire tournaments. Such a database could <a href = "https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/uy0zl4i1/release/4">prove useful</a> for researchers and players alike, pushing the sport forward.
