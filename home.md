<h5>About</h5>
This blog serves as an outlet to explore ideas which naturally interest me. I try to keep an informal, back-of-the-napkin style to these posts, hopefully a little like <a href = "http://www.tangotiger.com/index.php">Tom Tango</a>. Posts are grouped by topic in the header, but can be accessed in chronological order below.

<h5>Current independent work</h5>
I'm helping <a href = "https://twitter.com/iyer_prashanth">Prashanth Iyer</a> build an <a href="https://piyer97.shinyapps.io/NHLDraft2023/">interactive NHL draft tool</a> by applying a rank-ordered logit model to professional draft rankings. An outline of the methodology can be found on the "About the Model" tab of the tool, or <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/06/16/draft-probabilities-2.html">here</a>.

I'm building a <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/01/15/tennis-framework.html">tennis tracking program</a>, which hopefully will scale to the level where entities (players and ball) can be tracked for entire tournaments. Such a database could <a href = "https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/uy0zl4i1/release/4">prove useful</a> for researchers and players alike, pushing the sport forward.
</p>
<p>
I'm <a href = "https://spazznolo.github.io/goalies/">incrementally</a> building a goalie performance model with a focus on capturing uncertainty. So far, it has an empirical Bayes framework, with adjustments for shot quality and age.
