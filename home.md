<h5>About</h5>
This blog serves as an outlet to casually explore ideas which naturally interest me. I try to keep an informal, back-of-the-napkin style to these posts, hopefully a little like <a href = "http://www.tangotiger.com/index.php">Tom Tango</a>. Posts are grouped by topic in the header, but can be accessed in chronological order below.

<h5>Background</h5>
Around 2016, a few years removed from a Mathematics degree, my interest in proofs, statistics, and even logic puzzles was waning. I was leaning away from this towards creative pursuits. I was working odd jobs, reading fiction and making music. It was during this time, in this state of mind, that my brother lent me the book <em><a href = "http://www.hockeyabstract.com/statshot">Stat Shot</a></em>. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Stat Shot</em> was written as an entry point for the casual fan to understand advanced hockey statistics - as a fun, entertaining way to explore a different perspective of the sport. It was meant to be a light read, but this was not how I read it. To me, it was a blueprint. I came to understand the research process as a creative one. 
</p>
<p>
In my experience, research usually unfolds as follows: a curiosity arises from watching sports, listening to narratives, reading research papers, or just in conversations with friends; this then gives way to a qualitative debate both for and against the original idea; then, various quantitative frameworks are drafted, usually mentally. Based on the idea's complexity cost and worth, it is either pursued or forgotten. 
</p>
<p>
This process led me from independent research in hockey, to an internship at the St Lawrence River Institute, to my career as a Data Scientist in applied research at Statistics Canada, and to this blog.

<h5>Current independent work</h5>
I'm helping Prashanth Iyer build an <a href="https://piyer97.shinyapps.io/NHLDraft2023/">interactive NHL draft tool</a> by applying a rank-ordered logit model to draft rankings from publications over time.
</p>
<p>
I'm also building a <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/01/15/tennis-framework.html">tennis tracking program</a>, which hopefully will scale to the level where entities (players and ball) can be tracked for entire tournaments. Such a database could <a href = "https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/uy0zl4i1/release/4">prove useful</a> for researchers and players alike, pushing the sport forward.
