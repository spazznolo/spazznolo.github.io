Around 2016, I was a few years removed from a Mathematics degree. I had a waning proclivity for logic puzzles, was disintered in working in finance, and was leaning away from all of this towards creative pursuits. I was working odd jobs, reading fiction and making music. This was the state of my mind when my brother lent me the book <em>Stat Shot</em>. 
</p>
<p>
<a href = "http://www.hockeyabstract.com/statshot">Stat Shot</a> was marketed as an entry point for the casual fan to understand advanced hockey statistics - a fun, entertaining way to explore a different perspective of the sport. This was not how I read the book. To me, it was a blueprint. It was through this that I came to understand the research process is a creative one.

In my experience, research usually unfolds as follows: a curiosity arises from watching sports, listening to narratives, reading other research papers, or just in conversations with friends; this then gives way to qualitative arguments which xxx; then various quantitative frameworks are drafted. Based on the complexity cost and worth of the idea, it is either pursued or forgotten. 
</p>
<p>
This process led me from independent research in hockey, to an internship at the St Lawrence River Institute under xxx, to my career as a Data Scientist in applied research at Statistics Canada, and to this blog. This blog serves as an outlet to casually explore ideas which naturally interest me. I try to keep an informal, back-of-the-napkin style to these posts, a little like <a href = "http://www.tangotiger.com/index.php">Tom Tango</a>. Posts are grouped by topic in the header, but can be accessed in chronological order below.

I'm currently helping Prashanth Iyer build an <a href="https://piyer97.shinyapps.io/NHLDraft2023/">interactive NHL draft tool</a> by implementing a rank-ordered logit model to draft rankings from publications over time.

I'm also building a <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/01/15/tennis-framework.html">tennis tracking program</a>, which hopefully will scale to the level where entities (players and ball) can be tracked for entire tournaments. Such a database could <a href = "https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/uy0zl4i1/release/4">prove useful</a> for researchers and players alike, pushing the sport forward.
