<h5>About</h5>
This blog serves as an outlet to explore ideas which naturally interest me. I try to keep an informal, back-of-the-napkin style to these posts, hopefully a little like <a href = "http://www.tangotiger.com/index.php">Tom Tango</a>. Posts are grouped by topic in the header, but can be accessed in chronological order below.
<p>
<h5>Note</h5>
This blog is on hiatus as of September 2023, after having accepted a job with the Chicago Blackhawks, where I'll be working as a Data Scientist on their Hockey Analytics team.

<h5>Current independent work</h5>
<p>
I'm building a <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/01/15/tennis-framework.html">tennis tracking program</a>, which hopefully will scale to the level where entities (players and ball) can be tracked for entire tournaments. Such a database could <a href = "https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/uy0zl4i1/release/4">prove useful</a> for researchers and players alike, pushing the sport forward.
