<h5>Overtime</h5>
In the first post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/20/post-regulation-1.html">How important is post-regulation time?</a>, I introduce a framework to evaluate goalie performance using empirical Bayes. In the second post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/26/post-regulation-2.html">Measuring the uncertainty caused by the current overtime format</a>, I refine the methdology by accounting for shot quality. In the third post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/29/post-regulation-3.html">Is the overtime random?</a>, I refine the prior distribution by accounting for performance bias, where goalies who perform well tend to face more shots. In the fourth post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/30/post-regulation-4.html">Is the overtime random after each shot?</a>, I explore the effects of age on performance, and then attempt to account for this in the measurement of goalie performance.
