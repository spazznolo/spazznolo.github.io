<h5>Overtime</h5>
In the first post, <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/20/post-regulation-1.html">Post-regulation: How important is it?</a>, I introduce the series. In the <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/26/post-regulation-2.html">second post</a>, I measure the uncertainty caused by the current overtime format. In the third post, I explore whether <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/29/post-regulation-3.html">the overtime is random</a>. In the fourth post, I expand on the third post by exploring whether<a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/04/30/post-regulation-4.html">the overtime is random after each shot</a>.
