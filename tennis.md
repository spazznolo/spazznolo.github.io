<h5>Tennis Tracking</h5>
I'm building a tennis tracking program, which hopefully will scale to the level where entities (players and ball) can be tracked for entire tournaments. Such a database could <a href = "https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/uy0zl4i1/release/4">prove useful</a> for researchers and players alike, pushing the sport forward. 
<p>
The first iteration of this project lasted from September to December 2022. It lives as a <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2022/09/16/tennis-liveblog.html">liveblog</a> here, but will not be updated. I wanted to write about my progress in computer vision as it was happening. It served its purpose. Now, I'm focused on <a href="https://spazznolo.github.io/2023/01/15/tennis-framework.html">implementing my findings</a>.
